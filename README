A bunch of litmus tests for examining corner cases of GPU architectures.

GETTING STARTED
* Environment variables
You need CUDA library and OPENCL library paths:
$ export CUDADIR=/path/to/cuda
$ export CLDIR=/path/to/cuda
On Linux:
  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Or, on mac:
  $ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

* Build the clwrapper library
$ make

* Build the tests
Each test inside tests/ has a cuda/ or cl/ version. To make all tests:
$ cd tests
$ make all
