A bunch of litmus tests for examining corner cases of GPU architectures.

GETTING STARTED
First build the clwrapper library:
You need your CUDA library and OPENCL library path:
$ export CUDADIR=/path/to/cuda
$ export CLDIR=/path/to/cuda
$ make
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Each test inside tests/ has a cuda/ or cl/ version. To make all tests:
$ cd tests
$ make
